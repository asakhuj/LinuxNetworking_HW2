Note : You need root priveleges for both these programs. Moreover, we have made the following assumptions :

1) CPU usage : We have used the cpu_time counter for determining the CPU usage over a time of 3 seconds.

2) Memory usage : We have used two counters--> unused and available, to determine the used memory = available - unused

3) Exception handling is not done for the user input. Kindly enter the correct values as indicated .
